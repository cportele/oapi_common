^|A |A Service Metadata response SHOULD include the Service Identification and Service Provider metadata defined in the <<ogc-06-121,OGC Web Services Common 2.0 Standard>>.
^|B |Service Metadata SHOULD be encoded in the OpenAPI `Info` object.
^|C |To simplify access, the Service Metadata SHOULD be available as a separate resource from the Service Definition.
