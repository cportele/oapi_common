=== Web API Fundamentals

The following concepts are critical to understanding OGC Web API standards.

. The purpose of a Web API is to provide a uniform interface to <<resource-definition,resources>>.

. <<resource-definition,Resources>> are uniquely identified using <<uri-definition,Uniform Resource Identifiers>> (URI).

. A user manipulates a <<resource-definition,resource>> through <<representation-definition,representations>> of that <<resource-definition,resource>>.

. A <<representation-definition,representation>> is the current or intended state of a <<resource-definition,resource>> encoded for exchange between components.

. The format used to encode a <<representation-definition,representation>> is negotiated between the components participating in the exchange.

. <<representation-definition,Representations>> are exchanged between components using the HTTP protocol and the operations (GET, PUT, etc.) that HTTP supports.

[[identifier-conventions]]
=== Identifiers

The <<WEBARCH,Architecture of the World Wide Web>> establishes the URI as the single global identification system for the Web. Therefore, URIs or <<rfc6570,URI Templates>> are used in OGC Web API standards to identify key entities in those standards.  

In accordance with OGC policy, only the <<url-definition,Uniform Resource Locator (URL)>> form of URIs is used. 

The normative provisions in this draft standard are denoted by the URI `http://www.opengis.net/spec/ogcapi-common-1/1.0`. All <<requirement-definition,Requirements>>, <<ctm-definition,Conformance Modules>>, and <<ctc-definition,Conformance Classes>> that appear in this document are denoted by partial URIs that are relative to this base.

<<resource-definition,Resources>> described in this document are denoted by partial URIs that are relative to the `root` node of the API. This node serves as the head of the resource tree exposed through an API. In OpenAPI, the root node is identified by the `url` field of the https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md#server-object[Server Object]. In this document the tag `{root}` designates the root node of a URI.

The partial URIs used to identify <<resource-definition,Resources>> in this document are refered to as the resource `path`. The purpose of a resource `path` is to identify the referenced resource [underline]##within the context of this standard##. Implementors are encouraged to use these partial URIs in their implementations, thereby providing a common look and feel to OGC APIs.

This standard defines <<resource-definition,Resources>> which may appear in more than one place in the API. These <<resource-type-definition,Resource Types>> are identified by name rather than by URI. 

*Summary for Developers:*

<<rfc3986,RFC 3986>> defines a URI in Backus-Naur Form <<bnf-citation,(BNF)>> as follows:

[#uri-bnf,reftext='{image-caption} {counter:image-num}']
.Backus-Naur Definition of URI

[source,java]
----
    URI = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

        hier-part     = "//" authority path-abempty
                         / path-absolute
                         / path-rootless
                         / path-empty
                  
        authority     = [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ]
      
        path-abempty  = *( "/" segment )
      
        path-absolute = "/" [ segment-nz *( "/" segment ) ]
      
        path-rootless = segment-nz *( "/" segment )
      
        path-empty    = 0<pchar>
----

The following rules should be used when interpreting the BNF for use with this standard:

* `scheme` is assumed to be `HTTP` or `HTTPS` 
* `authority` is provided by the API developer 
* `{root}` designates the `scheme`, `authority`, and `path` to the root node of the API implementation. 
* only the `path-absolute` and `path-rootless` patterns are used
* parameters passed as part of an operation are encoded in the `query`. 
* parameters passed in HTTP headers or as cookies are out of scope for this Standard.

The following example shows a URI categorised according to RFC 3986 and OGC Web API standards.

[#uri-components,reftext='{image-caption} {counter:image-num}']
.Example URI and Components

[source,java]

          |           |            |            |           |
3986    scheme     authority     path         query      fragment
        \__________________________/\_____/\__________/

OGC                {root}             path   parameters         
----

This document does not restrict the lexical space of URIs used in the API beyond the requirements of the <<rc2616,HTTP>> and <<rc3986,URI Syntax>> IETF RFCs. If URIs include reserved characters that are delimiters in the URI subcomponent, these have to be percent-encoded. See Clause 2 of <<rfc3986,RFC 3986>> for details.

NOTE: OGC Web API standards may include a community-defined identifier as part of a URI (ex. image id or feature id). Definition of the format of those identifiers is out of scope for these standards. Implementors should take care that these identifiers are properly encoded (see <<rfc3986,RFC 3986>>) in the URIs for all hosted resources.

[[link-relation-conventions]]
=== Link relations

<<rfc8288,RFC 8288 (Web Linking)>> is used to express relationships between resources. Link relation types from the https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[IANA Link Relations Registry] are used wherever possible. Additional link relation types are registered with the https://github.com/opengeospatial/NamingAuthority/blob/master/incubation/linkRelationTypes/linkrelations.csv[OGC Link Relation Registry].

The link relationships used in API-Common Core are described in <<link-relations-table>>.

Each resource representation in this standard includes an array of links. Implementations are free to add additional links for all resources provided by the API. For example, an *enclosure* link could reference a bulk download of a collection. Or a *related* link on a feature could reference a related feature.

OGC API hyperlinks are defined using the following link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/oapi_common/blob/master/core/openapi/schemas/link.json[Hyperlink Schema].

[source, JSON]
include::openapi/schemas/link.json[]

In addition, links should be passed in the response using HTTP link headers. These links are accessible to the client without a need to process the resource. 

include::../general/recommendations/general/REC_link-header.adoc[]

Additional information on the use of link relationships is provided in the link:http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-071.html[OGC API - Common Users Guide].

[[https-conventions]]
=== Use of HTTPS

For simplicity, this document only refers to the HTTP protocol. This is not meant to exclude the use of HTTPS. It is simply a shorthand notation for "HTTP or HTTPS". In fact, most servers are expected to use <<rfc2818,HTTPS>>, not <<rfc2616,HTTP>>.

OGC Web API standards do not prohibit the use of any valid HTTP option. However, implementors should be aware that optional capabilities which are not in common use could be an impediment to interoperability.

[[api-definition-conventions]]
=== API definition

==== General remarks

This OGC standard specifies requirements and recommendations for APIs that share spatial resources and want to follow a standard way of doing so. In general, APIs will go beyond the requirements and recommendations stated in this standard. They will support additional operations, parameters, and so on that are specific to the API or the software tool used to implement the API.

So that developers can more easily learn how to use the API, good documentation is essential for every API. In the best case, documentation would be available both in HTML for human consumption and in a machine readable format that can be processed by software for run-time binding. OpenAPI is one way to provide that machine readable documentation.

==== Role of OpenAPI

This standard uses OpenAPI 3.0 fragments in its' examples and to formally state requirements. Using OpenAPI 3.0 is not required for implementing an OGC API. Other API definition languages may be used along with, or instead of, OpenAPI. However, any API definition language used should have an associated conformance class advertised through the `/conformance` path.  

This standard includes a <<rc_oas30-section,conformance class>> for API definitions that follow the <<openapi,OpenAPI specification 3.0>>. Alternative API definition languages are also allowed. Conformance classes for additional API definition languages will be added as the OGC API landscape continues to evolve.

==== References to OpenAPI components in normative statements

Some normative statements (requirements, recommendations and permissions) use a phrase that a component in the API definition of the server must be "based upon" a schema or parameter component in the OGC schema repository.

In this case, the following changes to the pre-defined OpenAPI component are permitted:

* If the server supports an XML encoding, `xml` properties may be added to the relevant OpenAPI schema components.
* The range of values of a parameter or property may be extended (additional values) or constrained (if a subset of all possible values is applicable to the server). An example for a constrained range of values is to explicitly specify the supported values of a string parameter or property using an _enum_.
* Additional properties may be added to the schema definition of a Response Object.
* Informative text may be changed or added, like comments or description properties.

For OGC API definitions that do not conform to the <<openapi,OpenAPI Specification 3.0>>, the normative statement should be interpreted in the context of the API definition language used.

==== Reusable OpenAPI components

Reusable components for OpenAPI definitions for an OGC API are referenced from this document. They are available from the OGC Schemas Registry at http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part1/1.0[http://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/common/part1/1.0].
