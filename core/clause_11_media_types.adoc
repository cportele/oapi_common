== Media Types

The typical media type for all "web pages" in an OGC Web API would be `text/html`.

The media type that would typically be used in an OGC Web API for machine-to-machine exchanges would be `application/json`.

The media types for an OpenAPI definition are `vnd.oai.openapi+json;version=3.0` (JSON) and `application/vnd.oai.openapi;version=3.0` (YAML).

NOTE: The OpenAPI media type has not been registered yet with IANA and may change.
